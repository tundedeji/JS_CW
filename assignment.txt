1:DECLARING A VARIABLE:

Declaring a variable means introducing it into the program, This is done using keywords like var,const and let
declaration doesn't assign any value to the variable, it just creates it in the memory.
eg let x, const y.

2: INITIALIZING A VARIABLE.
Initialization means assigning an initial value to a declared variable at the time of the declaration.
let y=10; const x=20; 
let age = 25
const pi = 3.14

3: Assigning a value to a variable
Assigning a value to a variable means giving it value after it has been declared and possibly initialized. you can
reassign a value to a variable declared with let or var but you cannot reassign a value declared with const.
 let x = 5; x= 10;
let name;
name = tom;
name = shedeur;
 (intialize and assign) const y = 7; y=7; (error cannot reassign const)
key difference is Timing and purpose.
understanding the difference helps with cleaner and more efficient codes. 

4: Reassign a Variable.
 Reassigning means giving a new value to an already intialized variable, Variables declared with let or var can be reassigned
but those declared with const cannot,
let z=50; z=15; var w=100; w=50; const y=23; y=24; (error)

5: Redeclaring a variable.
  Redeclaring a variable means declaring a variable with the same name again within the same scope, This can be done with var but
not with let or const, though it is not recommended in most cases. redeclaring var is not advisable because it can lead to
confusion or bugs. because it will overwrite the previous declaration without any error.
var x=5; var x=10; console.log(x);
with let or const (it will lead to errors).
